 submod_EC:0 "We had 2 packages of grass, 75 scripts, 5 icons, 20 bags of cocaine and a whole lot of bugs of all sorts and colors, depressants, as well as Russian foul language, rum, a box of beer, mecha and 2 dozen cans of energy drinks. Not that it was a necessary supply for a script, but if you started to script a submod, it becomes difficult to stop. The only thing that caused me concern was the mecha. Nothing in the world is more helpless, irresponsible and vicious than mecha. I knew that sooner or later we will go to this rubbish.\n\n§R- What kind of copy-paste is Petrosyan?§!"
